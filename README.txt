THIS CODE IS COMPRISED OF MULTIPLE CODERS JUST ADDING THEIR THINGS!
SO HOW THIS CODE WORKS CAN HEAVILY VARY FROM FILE TO FILE!!!

Also keep in mind that i (artvin) started coding here with only half a year of knowledege so you'll see a fuckton of shitcode.

Current coders that in anyway actively helped, in order of how much:

Batfoxkid
Artvin
Mikusch
Suza
Alex
Spookmaster

Alot of code is borrowed/just takes from other plugins i or friends made, often with permission,
rarely without cus i couldnt contact the person or it was just open sourcecode, credited anyways when i did that.

You will also see alot of "inconsistent indentation" warnings, if 1.11 compiler told me where this shit happend then i would fix it
but i honestly dont got the patience to look though all these sub files (more then 100)
